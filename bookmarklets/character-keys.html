<p>This bookmarklet triggers a <code>keypress</code> event for every printable character (and then some) on a US standard 101 keyboard. The keypress details are logged to the console.</p>

<p>In practice, this bookmarket will trigger any single character key shortcut on a page or application, surfacing potential <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/character-key-shortcuts.html">2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (A) issues</a>.</p>

<p>Related, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode/table">Toptal has a helpful keycode reference table</a>.</p>

<p>This test page contains a script that triggers an alert message when the <kbd>p</kbd> or <kbd>P</kbd> key is pressed. If the alerts appear when the bookmarklet is activated, the bookmarklet has successfully send those key presses.</p>

<script>
document.addEventListener("keydown", function(event) {
  const key = event.key;
  if (key === "p") { alert("Key p was pressed via the bookmarklet script!"); }
  if (key === "P") { alert("Key P (capital P) was pressed via the bookmarklet script!"); }
});
</script>
